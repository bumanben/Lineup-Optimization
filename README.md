# Lineup-Optimization
A project within the Sports Analytics Research Group of Johns Hopkins University 
This research project aims to develop a web-based tool for optimizing baseball batting lineups using advanced statistical analysis and optimization algorithms.
The project will combine historical baseball statistics, linear weights methodology, and modern optimization techniques to maximize expected run production.
A key feature will be the ability to incorporate user-defined constraints, allowing for practical application in real-world baseball scenarios.
